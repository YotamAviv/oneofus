/// I had ambitions but did not achieve them. This is not well planned, well documented, or well
/// excuted. See both Measure and Progress.

/// 1) Instrumentation to investigate what's slow, how slow, ...
/// Fire fetching is what's slow, and the performance seems to vary depending on cloud functions
/// number of calls, ?after=<after>, ?distinct, etc...
/// (I don't think computing takes time, just loading)

/// Progress dialog is related to this, and I was optimistic about combining the 2, but didn't.

/// Probably not: Stack push / pop?
/// I believe that only Fire fetching is slow.
/// Would be nice to know more about that. Oneofus costs, FollowNet costs, per user or token costs..
/// Future work on fetch?after=<time> or fetch?limit=<limit> would be affected by the ability to measure.
///
/// Both of these:
/// - Data structure output (probably JSON)
/// - Progress dialog

/// DEFER: Look for someone else's one of these instead of working on this one more.
/// DEFER: Consider doing something smart when 2 timers are running, like maybe suspend the outer
/// ones which inner ones are running; this would allow measure OneofusNet time minus Fire time.
